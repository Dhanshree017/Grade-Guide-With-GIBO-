# GIBO: Grade & Guide with GIBO
### *An Automated AI-Driven Evaluation System with Personalized Remedial Micro-Lessons*

GIBO (**Grading Intelligence for Behavioral Optimization**) is an end-to-end, multi-model evaluation and feedback system engineered for descriptive theory examinations in Machine Learning. Unlike conventional auto-graders that rely on shallow keyword matching, GIBO enforces strict institutional examination rules (section attempt limits, length compliance, and mark-mapping policies) while providing explainable grading and targeted micro-lessons directly to students.

## Key Highlights & Performance Metrics

* **Evaluation Accuracy**: Achieved **86.22% overall grading accuracy**.
* **Custom Dataset Engineering**: Built a proprietary dataset over **6 months** containing **~1,030 answer sheets** (~30 student sheets per Question Paper template) and over **12,000 Question-Answer pairs**.
* **High-Throughput Batch Processing**: Enables batch evaluations of **30+ student answer sheets** per grading session against a single question paper template.
* **Explainable AI Diagnostics**: Powered by **Gemini 1.5 Flash**, delivering Tri-Level Diagnostics (personalized feedback, missing concept identification, and tailored mini-lessons).
* **Automated Delivery Pipeline**: Compiles diagnostic reports and delivers itemized results directly to student email inboxes.

## Core System Architecture

GIBO operates across a 7-stage pipeline that bridges raw text extraction, deep semantic comparison, regressive score prediction, and LLM-driven feedback generation:

<div align="center">
  <img src="Images/System%20Architecture.png" alt="System Architecture" style="border: 3px solid black; padding: 4px;" />
  <p><em>Figure 1: High-level 7-module block diagram illustrating the GIBO processing pipeline.</em></p>
</div>

### Pipeline Breakdown:
1. **Question Paper Configuration and Parsing**: Parses complex multi-section question paper templates, extracting attempt constraints, mark allocations, and question definitions.
2. **Student Registration and Answer Sheet Management**: Digitizes, cleans, and indexes student response files against metadata schemas.
3. **Question–Answer Structuring and Rule Mapping**: Enforces institutional rules (e.g., "Attempt any 4 of 5") and dynamically computes maximum allowable marks per section.
4. **AI-Based Feature Extraction**: Embeds student responses and compares them against ideal candidate answers using **MiniLM** and **DeBERTa-v3** to extract semantic, logical, and structural features.
5. **Rule-Constrained Marks Allocation**: Uses an **XGBoost Regressor** to predict scores based on weighted semantic similarity, logical coherence, and strict length compliance heuristics.
6. **Feedback and Lesson Generation**: Leverages **Gemini 1.5 Flash** to analyze answer gaps and construct targeted mini-lessons for skipped or sub-optimal responses.
7. **Result Compilation and Delivery**: Automatically aggregates section scores, grade distributions, and feedback into direct student email reports and faculty dashboards.

## Machine Learning & Feature Engineering Pipeline

### Multi-Model Feature Extraction
To capture deep answer semantics rather than simple syntax, GIBO calculates three primary feature dimensions:

* **Semantic Similarity (Weight: 0.5)**: Powered by **DeBERTa-v3** to capture contextual and deep semantic alignment against ideal responses.
* **Logic & Structure (Weight: 0.4)**: Powered by **MiniLM** to evaluate concept flow, domain terminology consistency, and argument structure.
* **Length Compliance (Weight: 0.1)**: Strictly enforces target word count boundaries calibrated by question weightage:
  * **2 Marks**: 60–70 words
  * **5 Marks**: 120–130 words
  * **8 Marks**: 140–150 words
  * **10 Marks**: 170–200 words

### Marks Prediction Engine
Extracted feature vectors (Semantic, Logic, and Length Compliance scores) are passed into an **XGBoost Regressor** trained on 12,000+ human-graded question-answer pairs. The model outputs precise scores while adhering strictly to rule-constrained upper limits dictated by section-level attempt policies.

---

## Custom Dataset Engineering

Due to the lack of publicly available descriptive answer datasets for specialized engineering curricula, a proprietary benchmark dataset was systematically built over a 6-month development cycle:

* **Answer Sheets Processed**: ~1,030 full-length student answer sheets.
* **Question-Answer Pairs**: 12,000+ individually annotated responses.
* **Exam Templates**: Multiple distinct question paper structures covering core Machine Learning concepts (Supervised/Unsupervised Learning, Neural Networks, Optimization, Regularization, and Evaluation Metrics).
* **Ground Truth Annotation**: Each response was dual-graded by domain experts across correctness, logical structure, and clarity.

---

## Technical Stack

* **Machine Learning & NLP**: XGBoost, DeBERTa-v3, Sentence-Transformers (MiniLM), PyTorch, Scikit-learn
* **Large Language Models**: Gemini 1.5 Flash (Prompt Engineering, Tri-Level Remedial Generation)
* **Data Processing & Backend**: Python 3.10+, Pandas, NumPy, SQL
* **Notification Engine**: SMTP Email Service Engine
